<h2>Project</h2>
<p>
This project aims to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the ResNet architecture for age and gender detection from images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the CNN will learn to extract features that distinguish different age groups and genders directly from pixel data. The focus is on developing a robust model capable of accurate classification, integrating it into a practical system for real-world applications.
